The MDCF Architect
******************

The MDCF Architect is an `open source <https://github.com/santoslab/aadl-translator>`_ plugin for the |OSATE2| distribution of Eclipse that supports the development of `Medical Application Platform <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6197383&tag=1>`_ Apps. It operates on a :ref:`subset of AADL<aadl-subset-overview>`, and provides automatic translation to |MDCF| compatible, executable code. It also supports :ref:`hazard analysis annotations<hazard-analysis-overview>`, from which a hazard analysis report can be automatically generated.
